# üß† Mental Health AI Assistant

A full-stack AI-powered web app that helps mental health counselors generate tone-aware response suggestions for patients. It combines a locally trained ML classifier with GPT-based language generation, and supports semantic search through vector embeddings.

## üß© Key Features

- **Tone Classification**: Predicts therapist dialog tone category (Speaker Initiative, General, or Speaker Responsive) using a custom ML model.
- **GPT-Powered Suggestions**: Uses OpenAI's GPT to generate a response suggestion based on the predicted tone and patient's message.
- **Semantic Search**: Retrieve similar past counseling cases using text embeddings instead of keywords.
- **Modern UI**: Clean web interface deployed via Firebase Hosting.

## üß† How It Works

1. A user inputs a patient message via the web UI.
2. The message is sent to a Flask-based ML API which predicts the dialog tone.
3. The tone + message are passed to GPT through a Firebase Cloud Function.
4. GPT returns a tone-aligned suggestion for how the therapist might respond.
5. Users can also search for past cases using semantic search (via OpenAI embeddings).

## üß™ ML Model Details

- Source: 10 real-world counseling transcripts with 12 dialog act annotations
- Re-grouped into 3 higher-level tone classes for classification
- Preprocessing: removed duplicates, filtered short/empty entries
- Balanced via upsampling, trained using **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**
- Achieved ~94% **macro F1 score** on validation set

---

## üîç Semantic Search

Uses **OpenAI‚Äôs `text-embedding-3-small`** to encode patient messages into vectors.

- Stores vector embeddings + metadata in Firestore
- Computes cosine similarity between input vector and stored cases
- Returns top 5 most relevant past counseling exchanges

This helps users find similar emotional patterns or themes, even without exact keyword overlap.

## üíª Running Locally (Optional)

> Only needed if you want to explore how the app is wired together

### 1. Start the ML Model API (Flask)

Make sure you have **Python 3.9+**, and the following packages installed:

```bash
cd ml-backend/
python3 app.py
```
### 2. Tunnel to Public URL with ngrok

```bash
ngrok http 10000
```

Copy the public forwarding URL and update your frontend app.js:

```bash
const mlUrl = "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/predict";
```
### 3. Deploy Firebase Cloud Function

```bash
cd functions/
firebase deploy --only functions:getAdvice
```
This allows your frontend to call OpenAI securely without exposing your API key.

## üßë‚Äçüíª About This Project

This was a solo-built project designed to demonstrate how traditional **ML**, **LLMs**, **cloud functions**, and **full-stack deployment** can come together to solve a real-world problem in **mental health counseling**.

The goal wasn‚Äôt just to build a cool demo ‚Äî it was to create a **functional, reproducible tool** that acts as a proof of concept for tone-aware AI assistance in therapeutic settings.
